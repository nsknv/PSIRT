### Details


This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide) standards.


**Note:**


* Ampere products are not impacted.
* In an environment where the GPU is virtualized (for example, vGPU), you are not impacted.
* If the hypervisor is compromised or you have direct GPU access with bare metal or pass through, Turing, Volta, Pascal or Maxwell products can be exposed.
* Tegra X1, Tegra X1+, Tegra TX2 and Xavier products are impacted.
* In all cases, an attacker requires OS administrative/kernel rights.


| CVE ID | Description | Base Score | Vector |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|:------------------------------------|
| CVE‑2021‑23201 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in an internal microcontroller, which may allow a user with elevated privileges to generate valid microcode by identifying, exploiting, and loading vulnerable microcode. Such an attack could lead to information disclosure, data corruption, or denial of service of the device. The scope may extend to other components. | 7.5 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE‑2021‑23217 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller, which may allow a user with elevated privileges to instantiate a DMA write operation only within a specific time window timed to corrupt code execution, which may impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The scope impact may extend to other components. | 7.5 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE‑2021‑34400 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller which may allow a user with elevated privileges to gain access to information from unscrubbed memory, which may lead to information disclosure. | 4.1 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVE‑2021‑34399 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller which may allow a user with elevated privileges to gain access to information from unscrubbed registers, which may lead to information disclosure. | 4.1 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVE‑2021‑23219 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller, which may allow a user with elevated privileges to access protected information by identifying, exploiting, and loading vulnerable microcode. Such an attack may lead to information disclosure. | 4.1 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVE‑2021‑1125 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller which may allow a user with elevated privileges to corrupt program data. | 4.1 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE‑2021‑1105 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller which may allow a user with elevated privileges to access debug registers during runtime, which may lead to information disclosure. | 4.1 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
| CVE‑2021‑1088 | NVIDIA GPU and Tegra hardware contain a vulnerability in the internal microcontroller which may allow a user with elevated privileges to utilize debug mechanisms with insufficient access control, which may lead to information disclosure. | 4.1 | AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N |
The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk to your specific configuration.
