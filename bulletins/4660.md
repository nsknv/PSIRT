NVIDIA'S response to the Tegra RCM issue

### April 24, 2018


This notice is a response to recent publications on a security issue regarding NVIDIA Tegra Recovery Mode (RCM). A researcher indicates that a person with physical access to older Tegra-based processors could connect to the device's USB port, bypass the secure boot and execute unverified code.


This issue cannot be exploited remotely, even if the device is connected to the Internet. Rather, a person must have physical access to an affected processorâ€™s USB connection to bypass the secure boot and run unverified code.


At this time, NVIDIA is not aware of any malicious compromise of Tegra-based devices.


NVIDIA Tegra X2, which was launched in 2016, and later Tegra systems on a chip (SOCs) such as Xavier, are not affected by this issue. NVIDIA GPUs are not affected.


NVIDIA takes security concerns seriously, and is actively evaluating this issue and conferring with partners.
