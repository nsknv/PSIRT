### January 3, 2018


This notice is in response to Google Project Zero's publication of novel information disclosure attacks that combine CPU speculative execution with known side channels. The issue was disclosed January 3, 2018.


NVIDIA’s core business is GPU computing. We believe our GPU hardware is immune to the reported security issue and are updating our GPU drivers to help mitigate the CPU security issue. As for our SoCs with ARM CPUs, we have analyzed them to determine which are affected and are preparing appropriate mitigations.


Please actively monitor [NVIDIA Product Security](http://www.nvidia.com/product-security) for available mitigations, updates, and additional information.


To learn more about the vulnerability management process followed by the NVIDIA Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT), see the current list of NVIDIA security bulletins, or subscribe to security bulletin notifications, go to [NVIDIA Product Security](http://www.nvidia.com/product-security).
